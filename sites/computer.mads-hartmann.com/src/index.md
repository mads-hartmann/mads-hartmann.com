## Raycast


### Extensions

- **Apple Reminders**
Mostly to quickly add reminders.
- **Navigation**
	- Search Menu Items
	It’s the best. Allows you to use Raycast to search through the menu items of whatever application you have focused at the time.
- [**Spotify Player**](https://www.raycast.com/mattisssa/spotify-player)
Much nicer than the Spotify App. I have enabled “Close window on action”.
- [**Screenshot**](https://www.raycast.com/Aayush9029/screenshot)
Really useful for taking screenshots directly to the Clipboard. That way I don’t litter my Desktop with screenshots.
