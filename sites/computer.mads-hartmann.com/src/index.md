Hej üëã¬†welcome to computer.mads-hartmann.com. I use this little site to jot down notes about my computer. How it‚Äôs configured, what applications I use, and how I use them. It contains a little guide for bootstrapping new computers but mostly this is for documenting how I use my computer; documenting things helps me think.


## Applications


### VSCode

### 1Password


I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) for all my personal passwords, credit cards, credentials, and so on. I Install it using the App Store.


### Raycast


I use the following **built-in extensions**

- **Search Emoji & Symbols**
I use this **all the time**. I have this mapped to ^‚åòSpace so that it overwrites the default Emoji picker in macOS
- **Navigation**
I primarily use the ‚ÄúSearch Menu Items‚Äù command. It‚Äôs the best. Allows you to use Raycast to search through the menu items of whatever application you have focused at the time.
- **Window Management**
I use this a ton for very basic window management. ‚ÄúCenter‚Äù is mapped to ‚åò‚å•C, ‚ÄúLeft Half‚Äù to ‚åò‚å•‚Üê, ‚ÄúRight Half‚Äù to ‚åò‚å•‚Üê, and Maximize ‚åò‚å•‚Üµ.

I use the following extensions from the [Raycast Store](https://www.raycast.com/store):

- [Apple Reminders](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/apple-reminders)
I use the ‚ÄúMy Reminders‚Äù command get a quick overview or modify the individual reminders and ‚ÄúCreate Reminder‚Äù to quickly adding new reminders.
- [Screenshot](https://www.raycast.com/Aayush9029/screenshot)
Really useful for taking screenshots directly to the Clipboard. That way I don‚Äôt litter my Desktop with screenshots.
- [Color Picker](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/color-picker)
Quickest and simplest way to grab the hex code of a pixel on your screen.
- [Spotify Player](https://www.raycast.com/mattisssa/spotify-player)
Much nicer than the Spotify App. I have enabled ‚ÄúClose window on action‚Äù.
- [Word Search](https://www.raycast.com/rishabswift/word-search)
I primarily use this for the ‚ÄúSpell a Word‚Äù command which allows me to attempt to spell a word and then pick the correct spelling. It‚Äôs convient when I know I want to write a word that I can never spell correctly in the first attempt.

## Setting Up a New Mac


### Setting up Nix


To install Nix I do need some basic development tools installed like¬†`git`,¬†`curl`¬†and so on:


```bash
xcode-select --install
```


I install Nix using¬†[The Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)


```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```


### Shell


Don‚Äôt show the¬†`Last login`¬†message for every new terminal session:


```bash
touch ~/.hushlogin
```


Install Starship


```bash
nix profile install nixpkgs#starship
```


Create a basic profile for ZSH (`touch ~/.zshrc`) and add the following


```bash
alias tailscale="/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale"

# Produced by starship init zsh
source <(/Users/mads/.nix-profile/bin/starship init zsh --print-full-init)

autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```


SSH


I use 1Password to manage my SSH keys ([docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh)) and rely on their SSH agent ([docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent)). For the agent to work the following is placed in¬†`~/.ssh/config`:


```bash
Host *
  IdentityAgent "~/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock"
```


To verify it works run the following


```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/Library/Group\ Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock
ssh-add -l
```


### devenv


I use¬†[devenv](https://devenv.sh/)¬†where I can:


```bash
nix profile install github:cachix/devenv/v0.6
```


## Changelog


The current version is v3

- v3 - The biggest difference between v2 and v3 is that this is now authored in Notion and then exported as markdown. This should hopefully mean that I find it easier to update along the way.
- [v2](https://computer.mads-hartmann.com/v2) - the major change from¬†[v1](https://computer.mads-hartmann.com/v1)¬†is that I now do 99% of my development in¬†[Cloud Development Environments (CDE)](https://www.gitpod.io/cde)¬†which means that I install¬†_very_¬†few tools locally.
- [v1](https://computer.mads-hartmann.com/v1) - the original [computer.mads-hartmann.com](http://computer.mads-hartmann.com/)
