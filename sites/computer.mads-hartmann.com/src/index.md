Hej 👋 welcome to computer.mads-hartmann.com. I use this little site to jot down notes about my computer. How it’s configured, what applications I use, and how I use them. It contains a little guide for bootstrapping new computers but mostly this is for documenting how I use my computer; documenting things helps me think.


## Applications


### 1Password


I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) for all my personal passwords, credit cards, credentials, and so on. I Install it using the App Store.


### Raycast


I use the following **Raycast Extensions** from the [Raycast Store](https://www.raycast.com/store). They’re sorted alphabetically

- [**Apple Reminders**](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/apple-reminders)
I use the “My Reminders” command get a quick overview or modify the individual reminders and “Create Reminder” to quickly adding new reminders.
- **Navigation
This is one of the native extensions that ship with Raycast. I primarily use the “**Search Menu Items” command. It’s the best. Allows you to use Raycast to search through the menu items of whatever application you have focused at the time.
- [**Screenshot**](https://www.raycast.com/Aayush9029/screenshot)
Really useful for taking screenshots directly to the Clipboard. That way I don’t litter my Desktop with screenshots.
- [**Spotify Player**](https://www.raycast.com/mattisssa/spotify-player)
Much nicer than the Spotify App. I have enabled “Close window on action”.
- [Word Search](https://www.raycast.com/rishabswift/word-search)
I primarily use this for the “Spell a Word” command which allows me to attempt to spell a word and then pick the correct spelling. It’s convient when I know I want to write a word that I can never spell correctly in the first attempt.

## Setting Up a New Mac


### Setting up Nix


To install Nix I do need some basic development tools installed like `git`, `curl` and so on:


```bash
xcode-select --install
```


I install Nix using [The Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)


```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```


### Shell


Don’t show the `Last login` message for every new terminal session:


```bash
touch ~/.hushlogin
```


Install Starship


```bash
nix profile install nixpkgs#starship
```


Create a basic profile for ZSH (`touch ~/.zshrc`) and add the following


```bash
alias tailscale="/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale"

# Produced by starship init zsh
source <(/Users/mads/.nix-profile/bin/starship init zsh --print-full-init)

autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```


SSH


I use 1Password to manage my SSH keys ([docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh)) and rely on their SSH agent ([docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent)). For the agent to work the following is placed in `~/.ssh/config`:


```bash
Host *
  IdentityAgent "~/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock"
```


To verify it works run the following


```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/Library/Group\ Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock
ssh-add -l
```


### devenv


I use [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) where I can:


```bash
nix profile install github:cachix/devenv/v0.6
```


### VSCode


I try to keep my local configuration minimal.


Installed extensions snap-shotted on the 5th of March 2023


```bash
code --list-extensions
```

## Changelog


The current version is v3

- v3 - The biggest difference between v2 and v3 is that this is now authored in Notion and then exported as markdown. This should hopefully mean that I find it easier to update along the way.
- [v2](https://computer.mads-hartmann.com/v2) - the major change from [v1](https://computer.mads-hartmann.com/v1) is that I now do 99% of my development in [Cloud Development Environments (CDE)](https://www.gitpod.io/cde) which means that I install _very_ few tools locally.
- [v1](https://computer.mads-hartmann.com/v1) - the original [computer.mads-hartmann.com](http://computer.mads-hartmann.com/)
