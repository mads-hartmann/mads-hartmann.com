Recently I've been feeling the urge to play around with tech for no other reason than the enjoyment of figuring out how something works. I haven't felt this way for a very long time so I cherish the feeling; turns out I might not be devolving into an un-excitable blob as I hard feared.

Here's a short list of the topics that are most present in my mind, in no specific order:

- macOS [Hypervisor.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor)
- Unikernels - I've been sort-of-but-not-really following along since my OCaml days (~2015) and want to see what's happened in this space.
- OCaml - I used to love it and want to see what it feels like using it today.
- Rust - I never really learned it, but I quite suspect I'll like it.
- Real-time sync engine - I watched the [Linear Sync engine talks](https://linear.app/blog/scaling-the-linear-sync-engine) and find the approach quite intriguing; I haven't worked on a webapp with this kind of architecture before.
- CRDTs - They seem to be increasingly relevant and I never built anything with them
- SwiftUI - I have a few ideas for small-ish natives macOS apps I'd like to create.
- WebGPU - I have zero experience with GPU programming, and WebGPU seems to be a fairly easy way to play around with it as I'm familiar with all of the surrounding technologies.

My current thinking is to pick any number of the topics above an built little prototypes with them throughout the year; small enough in scope that I can actually complete them with the limited spare time I have. I guess we'll see if my motivation holds once I'm fully back from vacation ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤ž
