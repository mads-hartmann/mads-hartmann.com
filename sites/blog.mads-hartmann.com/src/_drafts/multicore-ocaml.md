# Multicore Ocaml

I'm coming back to writing OCaml after having not written it for about 10 years. Since then, OCaml has added multicore support. I'm trying to learn what that's all about.

This is a series of question/answers that I've bene working through trying to understand it.

## Why wasn't OCaml multi-core ready before

## How was parallelism achieved before this

## What new primitives, if any, were introduced to OCaml to support multi-core support
